# JpWordQuest

This app will let you practice your JP knowledge while having fun!

# Considerations
-Encrypt the correct answer on the backend and then decrypt on the frontend to show answer so that you can't inspect code to see correct answer. Possible but doesn't make sense since this is just a learning tool so there is no point in cheating.
-Leaderboard; Don't really want to make this competitive so decided not to implement
